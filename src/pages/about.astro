      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Our Story</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Staticfish was founded on a simple idea: the web has become too slow and complicated for most small businesses. We believe in the power of static sitesâ€”they're incredibly fast, highly secure, and affordable to run. Our mission is to bring these benefits to small business owners, so they can focus on what they do best, not on maintaining a complex website.</p>
      <p>We handle everything from design to deployment, providing a hassle-free experience and a final product that is built to last.</p>
